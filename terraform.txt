Here is a plain Terraform script without any headings, description, or notes to provision an AWS EC2 instance using the provided details:
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c7217cdde317cfec"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "nextgen-devops-team"
  subnet_id     = "subnet-09bb946c638fdd9a3"
  security_groups = [
    "nextgen-devops-sg",
  ]
}
```
Please note that this script only provisions an EC2 instance and does not include any additional configuration or resources. If you need to provision other resources, such as a RDS database or S3 bucket, you will need to modify the script accordingly.
