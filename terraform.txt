Hi there! I'm happy to help you with your Terraform script. Here is the script you requested:
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c7217cdde317cfec"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "nextgen-devops-team"
  subnet_id     = "subnet-09bb946c638fdd9a3"
}
```
Please note that this script only provisions an EC2 instance and does not include any other resources or configurations. If you need to provision additional resources, such as a security group or an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, you will need to modify the script accordingly.

Is there anything else you would like me to help with?
