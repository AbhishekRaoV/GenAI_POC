Hi there! I'm here to help you with your Terraform script. Can you please provide the details of the AWS EC2 instance you want to provision?

Please provide the following information:

1. AMI ID
2. Instance type
3. Key pair
4. Subnet ID

Once you provide these details, I can help you create a plain Terraform script without any headings, descriptions, or notes to provision the AWS EC2 instance.

Go ahead and provide the details!
