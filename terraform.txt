Hello! I'm here to help you with your Terraform script. Can you please provide me with the details you have so far?

Please provide the following information:

1. AMI ID
2. Instance type
3. Key pair name
4. Subnet ID

Once you provide these details, I can help you create a Terraform script to provision an AWS EC2 instance using those specifications.
