Here's the Terraform script to provision an EC2 instance in AWS with the specified details:
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c7217cdde317cfec"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "nextgen-devops-team"
  subnet_id    = "subnet-09bb946c638fdd9a3"
}
```
Please note that this script only provisions an EC2 instance and does not create any additional resources such as a security group or an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume. If you need these resources, please let me know and I can update the script accordingly.

Also, please note that the `ami` ID should be replaced with the actual ID of the AMI you want to use.
