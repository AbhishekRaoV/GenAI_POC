Hi there! I'm here to help you with your Terraform script. Can you please provide the details you have so far?

Please note that I will not be able to store any data, so make sure to include all the necessary information in your question.

Also, please keep in mind that I'm just an AI and do not have the ability to execute scripts or access external systems. I can only provide guidance and answer questions based on my training.

What is the purpose of your Terraform script? Do you want to create an EC2 instance using a specific AMI, instance type, key pair, subnet, and security group?
