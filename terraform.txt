Hello! I'm here to help you with your Terraform script. Please provide the details you'd like me to use, and I'll be happy to assist you in creating a plain Terraform script without any headings or notes.

Please provide the following information:

1. AMI ID
2. Instance type
3. Key pair name
4. Subnet ID

Once you provide these details, I can help you create a Terraform script to provision an AWS EC2 instance using those specifications.
