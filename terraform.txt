Hello! I'm here to help you with your Terraform script. Please provide the details you'd like me to use, and I'll be happy to assist you in creating the script.

Please provide the following information:

1. AMI ID
2. Instance type
3. Key pair name
4. Subnet ID

Once you provide these details, I can help you create a plain Terraform script without any headings, descriptions, or notes to provision an AWS EC2 instance using the provided details.
