Hello! I'm here to help you with your Terraform script. Please provide the details you'd like me to use, and I'll be happy to assist you in creating a plain Terraform script without any headings or notes.

Please provide the following information:

* AMI ID
* Instance type
* Key pair name
* Subnet ID

Once you provide these details, I can help you create a Terraform script that provisions an AWS EC2 instance using the specified details.
