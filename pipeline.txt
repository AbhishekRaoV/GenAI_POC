Here is a plain Jenkins pipeline script without any headings, description, notes to provision an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform:
```bash
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Init') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform init'
            }
        }
        stage('Validate') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform validate'
            }
        }
        stage('Apply') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform apply'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This script assumes that you have a Terraform configuration file named `main.tf` in the same directory as the pipeline script, and that the file contains the necessary configuration to provision an EC2 instance. The script uses the `terraform init`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform apply` commands to initialize, validate, and apply the Terraform configuration, respectively.

Note that this script does not include any headers or descriptions, as you requested. Also, please note that this is just a sample script, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs.
