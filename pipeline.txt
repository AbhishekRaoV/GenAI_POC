Here is a Jenkins pipeline script that you can use to execute the Terraform script in an automated way:
```
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Init') {
      steps {
        // Initialize Terraform
        sh 'terraform init'
      }
    }

    stage('Validate') {
      steps {
        // Validate the Terraform configuration
        sh 'terraform validate'
      }
    }

    stage('Apply') {
      steps {
        // Apply the Terraform changes
        sh 'terraform apply --auto-approve'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This pipeline script will run the following commands in each stage:

1. `terraform init`: This command initializes Terraform and sets up the environment for running the Terraform script.
2. `terraform validate`: This command validates the Terraform configuration to ensure that it is correct and can be applied successfully.
3. `terraform apply --auto-approve`: This command applies the Terraform changes to the AWS infrastructure, using the `--auto-approve` flag to automatically approve any necessary changes.

You can run this pipeline script in a Jenkins instance, or you can use a tool like Jenkins Pipeline Plugin for Eclipse, to run this script.

Please note that you need to have the `terraform` command installed on your system, and you need to have the AWS credentials set up correctly, in order to run this script successfully.
