Here is a plain Jenkins pipeline script without any headings, description, notes to terraform init, validate, and apply to provision an AWS EC2 instance:
```bash
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Terraform Initialize') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform init'
      }
    }

    stage('Terraform Validate') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform validate'
      }
    }

    stage('Terraform Apply') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform apply'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This script assumes that you have already created a Terraform configuration file with the necessary resources defined. The `agent any` line specifies that any available agent can run this pipeline. The stages are defined as follows:

1. Terraform Initialize: This stage runs the `terraform init` command to initialize the Terraform environment.
2. Terraform Validate: This stage runs the `terraform validate` command to validate the configuration before applying it.
3. Terraform Apply: This stage runs the `terraform apply` command to provision the AWS EC2 instance.

Note that this script does not include any Jenkinsfile syntax, so you will need to save it as a plain text file and run it in Jenkins.
