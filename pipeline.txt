Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. To execute the Terraform script in an automated way, you can use a Jenkins pipeline. Here's a sample pipeline script that you can use:
```bash
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Init') {
            steps {
                // Initialize Terraform
                sh 'terraform init'
            }
        }
        stage('Validate') {
            steps {
                // Validate the Terraform configuration
                sh 'terraform validate'
            }
        }
        stage('Apply') {
            steps {
                // Apply the Terraform changes
                sh 'terraform apply --auto-approve'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This pipeline will run three stages:

1. `Init`: This stage initializes Terraform by running the `terraform init` command.
2. `Validate`: This stage validates the Terraform configuration by running the `terraform validate` command.
3. `Apply`: This stage applies the Terraform changes by running the `terraform apply --auto-approve` command. The `--auto-approve` flag tells Terraform to automatically approve any changes that are required for the deployment.

You can save this script as a Jenkinsfile in your project's root directory, and then run it using the Jenkins "Build" button. This will execute the pipeline and deploy your infrastructure using Terraform.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
