Here is a plain Jenkins pipeline script without any headings, description, notes to terraform init, validate, and apply to provision an AWS EC2 instance:
```bash
pipeline {
  agent any
  
  stages {
    stage('Terraform Initialize') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform init'
      }
    }
    
    stage('Terraform Validate') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform validate'
      }
    }
    
    stage('Terraform Apply') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform apply'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This script assumes that you have already installed the AWS SDK and the Terraform provider on your Jenkins instance. It uses the `sh` step to run the Terraform commands, which will provision an EC2 instance using the `aws_instance` resource defined in your Terraform configuration.

Note that this script does not include any error handling or logging, so you may want to add those features to your actual pipeline.
