Here is a plain Jenkins pipeline script without any headings, description, notes to terraform init, validate, and apply to provision an AWS EC2 instance:
```bash
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Terraform Initialize') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform init'
      }
    }

    stage('Terraform Validate') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform validate'
      }
    }

    stage('Terraform Apply') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform apply'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This script assumes that you have already created a Terraform configuration file with the necessary resources defined. The `terraform init` command initializes the Terraform environment, the `terraform validate` command validates the configuration, and the `terraform apply` command provisions the resources.

Note that this script uses the `sh` step to run the Terraform commands, which will execute them in a shell. You may want to use a specific shell command instead, depending on your environment.
