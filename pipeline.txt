Here is a Jenkins pipeline script that you can use to execute the Terraform script in an automated way:
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Init') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform init'
            }
        }
        stage('Validate') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform validate'
            }
        }
        stage('Apply') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform apply --auto-approve'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This script uses the `agent any` agent, which means that any available agent can run the pipeline. The pipeline has three stages:

1. `Init`: This stage runs the `terraform init` command to initialize the Terraform environment.
2. `Validate`: This stage runs the `terraform validate` command to validate the Terraform configuration.
3. `Apply`: This stage runs the `terraform apply --auto-approve` command to apply the Terraform changes. The `--auto-approve` flag automatically approves any changes that are made during the apply operation.

You can save this script as a file (e.g., `terraform.pipeline`) and then run it in Jenkins using the `Pipeline` job type.
