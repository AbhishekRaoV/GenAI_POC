Here is a Jenkins pipeline script that you can use to execute the Terraform script in an automated way:
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Init') {
            steps {
                // Initialize Terraform
                sh 'terraform init'
            }
        }

        stage('Validate') {
            steps {
                // Validate the Terraform configuration
                sh 'terraform validate'
            }
        }

        stage('Apply') {
            steps {
                // Apply the Terraform changes
                sh 'terraform apply --auto-approve'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This pipeline script will run the `terraform init`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform apply` commands in sequence. The `terraform apply` command will use the `--auto-approve` flag to automatically approve any changes that are made during the apply process.

Note that you will need to replace the `agent any` line with the name of the Jenkins agent that you want to use for this pipeline. Additionally, you may need to modify the `sh` commands to use the full path to the Terraform executable, depending on your environment.
