Jenkins Pipeline Script:
```bash
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/hashed/terraform-aws-eks.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Terraform Apply') {
            steps {
                sh ' Terraform apply --auto-approve'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This is a Jenkinsfile that defines a pipeline with two stages: "Checkout" and "Terraform Apply". The "Checkout" stage uses Git to retrieve the code from the specified GitHub repository. The "Terraform Apply" stage runs the Terraform apply command with the --auto-approve option to automatically approve any changes made by the Terraform script.

Please note that this is just an example, you should adjust the repository URL and the terraform command according to your needs.
